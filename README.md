# Tech-Learning-Journey

Welcome to my **Tech Learning Journey**! This repository documents my hands-on labs, projects, and practical exercises as I grow my skills in **Cybersecurity**, **Networking**, and **NetDevOps**. It serves as both a personal learning journal and a professional portfolio showcasing my progress.


Each folder contains:
- **README.md** with lab objectives, tools used, steps, findings, and lessons learned  
- Supporting files such as screenshots, scripts, or packet captures


## Learning Focus Areas

### 1. Cybersecurity
- Packet capture & traffic analysis (DNS, HTTP, TCP/UDP)
- Vulnerability scanning & lab exercises
- Network security fundamentals

### 2. Networking
- Routing & switching (VLANs, OSPF, static routes)
- Network troubleshooting and lab simulations
- Hands-on practice with Cisco/Arista/Fortigate topology setups

### 3. NetDevOps
- Network automation with Python, Ansible, and Terraform
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) exercises
- Scripting repetitive network tasks
